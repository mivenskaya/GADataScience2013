I ran a logistic regression analysis on a contraceptive method choice dataset that I got from here:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Contraceptive+Method+Choice

Variable information:
1. Wife's age (numerical) 
2. Wife's education (categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high 
3. Husband's education (categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high 
4. Number of children ever born (numerical) 
5. Wife's religion (binary) 0=Non-Islam, 1=Islam 
6. Wife's now working? (binary) 0=Yes, 1=No 
7. Husband's occupation (categorical) 1, 2, 3, 4 
8. Standard-of-living index (categorical) 1=low, 2, 3, 4=high 
9. Media exposure (binary) 0=Good, 1=Not good 
10. Contraceptive method used (class attribute) 1=No-use, 2=Long-term, 3=Short-term

I turned this into a binary problem by adding a variable "has.contraception" (no use vs. long-term or short-term).

I first ran a logistic regression with all the variable and got an error rate of .46.  
By getting rid of the most non-predicitve variables (husband's education, husband's occupation - not surprisingly), I was able to make the 
error rate decrease, but not significantly.  Taking out the variable "Wife's now working" made the error rate go down slightly further, 
but also not by much (to .458).  Getting rid of any other variable made the error rate go up.

Some interesting observations:  Wife's age is very predictive. Suprisingly, the higher the age, the less likely the woman to use contraception.
